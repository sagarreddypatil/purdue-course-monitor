It focuses on teaching principles and methods needed to analyze large datasets in order to extract novel, transformative insights for the underlying application. The course emphasizes the duality between formulating questions that can be answered by statistical data analysis tools (the statistical perspective) and the algorithmic challenge of actually extracting such answers using available parallel and distributed computational resources from massive datasets. The topics cover three areas: (1) algorithmic concepts necessary for big data analytics, (2) bid data systems, including data management and programming, and (3) advanced analytic methods to address characteristics of real-world big data problems.\n<br>\n    0.000 OR     3.000 Credit hours\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_catalog_syllabus?cat_term_in=202320&amp;subj_code_in=CS&amp;crse_numb_in=44000\">Syllabus Available</a>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Levels: </span>Graduate, Professional, Undergraduate \n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Schedule Types: </span>Distance Learning, <a href=\"/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202320&amp;subj_in=CS&amp;crse_in=44000&amp;schd_in=LAB\">Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202320&amp;subj_in=CS&amp;crse_in=44000&amp;schd_in=LEC\">Lecture</a> \n<br>\n<a href=\"/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202320&amp;subj_in=CS&amp;crse_in=44000&amp;schd_in=\">All Sections for this Course</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\"><b>Offered By: </b></span>College of Science \n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\"><b>Department: </b></span>Computer Science \n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Course Attributes: </span><br>Upper Division \n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">May be offered at any of the following campuses:</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; West Lafayette\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Learning Outcomes: </span>\n1.

The goal of this course is to teach students how to design useful and usable interactive systems that address important needs of people. Students will experience the entire user-centered design life cycle, from need finding to usability evaluation. Topics covered in the course include user-centered design principles, usability heuristics, need-finding methods such as semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiry, quick prototyping techniques, usability evaluation methods such as hallway testing and human-subjects user study, and theories about user interaction and decision making. As we are entering a new era of AI, the course will also include a brief introduction on how to apply the HCI principles and techniques to AI-powered systems. This course is project-based. Students will form project teams among themselves to work on a semester-long project and apply the user-centered design principles, theories, and techniques that they have learned in class to build a useful and usable interactive system such as a mobile application. This course is also highly interactive, including a series of design studios and in-class activities that require active participation, communication, and discussion with other students.\n<br>\n    3.000 Credit hours\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_catalog_syllabus?cat_term_in=202320&amp;subj_code_in=CS&amp;crse_numb_in=47500\">Syllabus Available</a>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Levels: </span>Graduate, Professional, Undergraduate \n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Schedule Types: </span>Distance Learning, <a href=\"/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202320&amp;subj_in=CS&amp;crse_in=47500&amp;schd_in=LEC\">Lecture</a> \n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\"><b>Offered By: </b></span>College of Science \n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\"><b>Department: </b></span>Computer Science \n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Course Attributes: </span><br>Upper Division \n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">May be offered at any of the following campuses:</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; West Lafayette\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"fieldlabeltext\">Learning Outcomes: </span>\n1.

The area of randomized algorithms has grown from being a tool in computational number theory to finding widespread application in algorithms in all areas of computer science. Two practical benefits of randomization are its simplicity and speed. Deep and important computational complexity connections have been developed,  from bridging the gap between discrete and continuous optimization, bypassing deterministic barriers in online settings, summarizing massive data in polylogarithmic space, probabilistically checkable proofs, privacy enhancing techniques, modeling the web and other large networks, and sparsifying and compressing complicated combinatorial structures such as graphs. Randomization is an essential  key ingredient in the algorithmic breakthroughs today and in the future. This course presents the basic concepts in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and shows how to apply them to algorithms for a wide range of problems.

This course introduces the concept of pidgin and creole languages across the world, with a focus on English-based pidgins and creoles. It addresses their geographical distribution and some of their cultural manifestations such as music, food and literature on both sides of the Atlantic. The course presents a general view of the historical events that led to the formation of creole languages and to the development of the African diaspora. We will consider different varieties of creole languages and (their) cultures including English-based creoles in West Africa such as Kru (Liberia and Sierra Leone), Nigerian Pidgin and Cameroonian Pidgin; in the Caribbean such as Jamaican, San Andreas, Nicaraguan and Limonense, contrasting them with the Spanish-based creole Palenquero; and the three most predominant creoles in the U.S. - Louisiana Creole, Gullah and Hawaii Creole, to understand their characteristics and their history. We will explore the ways in which the languages manifest in the music and literature of the contexts where they are spoken. Finally, we will consider the African diaspora as a fundamental thread that ties (English-based) creole languages and peoples together.

This course introduces the basic concepts and methods of applied statistics in all areas of science and engineering. Three distinctive features of this honors course are: (1) self-learning and discovery of concepts and methods of statistical analysis through guided instructions, literature search, derivation and simulation; (2) classroom participation - both individually and collaboratively - in active learning of difficult concepts; and (3) communicating such learning to general readers. Students will acquire a basic competence in using statistical freeware R, in presenting data visually, in analyzing data appropriately, in interpreting the results in the context of research problems, and in communicating findings in plain but impactful language to readers not trained in Statistics. STAT-S351 extends all material covered in STAT 35000 to a deeper level, and gives glimpses into some methodologies delegated to advanced courses, thereby motivating and preparing students to take advanced undergraduate statistics courses.
